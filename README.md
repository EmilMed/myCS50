# Hello👨🏻‍💻

## This is the repository dedicated to all of my work done during the completion of the Harvard CS50x course!

Here i collected all the files for weeks' 0-10 problem sets, including the final project in the folder 'final'. One of the most frequently used languages throughout this course was C, also Python and front end languages like JS, HTML and CSS. It has been an exhilarating adventure and I cannot wait to apply the acquired skills in the future projects!
