Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: from 10 to 100 simulations time decreased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000 because it took less than a second, and the predictions are very close to 1000000 simulations.
